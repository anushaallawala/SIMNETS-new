/** \brief Runs tSNE after PCA

 This class allows to run tSNE on data which has more dimensions than observations.
 To this end, a principal component analysis is performed first, reducing the
 dimensionality of the data to the number of observations, then performs tSNE.
 This algorithm then also provides a means to project new data into the tSNE
 space, using the method @ref projectDataIntoTSNESpace.
